    "## Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief outline of the benefits of using `fh-dev-utils`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Super-easy to dynamically build Tailwind styles!\n",
    "2. Compatible with [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).\n",
    "3. Cach buster to bypass browser styles during development.\n",
    "4. Run a Jupyter notebook server alongside your FastHTML app.\n",
    "5. Database browser to easily view/manage your apps db tables and records.\n",
    "6. TailwindCSS intellisense for a great developer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's recommended by the authors of TailwindCSS uses a build step to compile styles for published websites, rather than just add the CDN version to the site header. \n",
    "\n",
    "And if you like using Tailwind for your app styling then make sure you [enable intellisense](#tailwind-intellisense). This is only available if you dynamically build your styles. Being able to see inline color information, all available tailwind classes, and what CSS a class will be converted into is a game-changer!\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete list of the benefits of compiling TailwindCSS styles can be found [here](#tailwindcss-dynamic-build).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fh-dev-utils` package helps during the devlopment of FastHTML applications by adding support for live TailwindCSS build, a Jupyter notebook server, and an SQLite viewer/manager via the `serve_dev()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a `cache_buster()` function available to help prevent caching of CSS styles during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [here](https://exploringml.github.io/fh-dev-utils/serve_dev.html) for the full definition of `serve_dev()` and `cache_buster()` plus all available parameters."

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the `fh-dev-utils` package from PyPi.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ pip install fh-dev-utils\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then import the `fh_dev_utils` package inside your FastHTML application.\n",

    "`main.py`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fasthtml.common import *\n",
    "from fh_dev_utils.serve import *\n",

    "\n",
    "#serve()\n",
    "serve_dev()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the default `serve()` function with `serve_dev()`. This performs the same functionality as `serve()` but includes a few additional enhancements, which make developing FastHTML applications a little easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently `serve_dev()` offers three main features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TailwindCSS styles dynamic build process\n",
    "2. Jupyter notebook server\n",
    "3. SQLite database browser\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you use `serve_dev()` without any options then it performs the exact same function as `serve()`."

    "## 1. TailwindCSS Dynamic Build\n",
    " \n",
    "Uses the TailwindCSS CLI to dynamically build styles as you edit your apps source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smaller CSS files size (only build what you have defined)\n",
    "- Recommended best practice from the authors of TailwindCSS:\n",
    "  - > The [Play] CDN is designed for development purposes only, and is not intended for production.\n",
    "- Use dynamic selectors such as `mb-[34px]`\n",
    "- TailwindCSS intellisense support\n",
    "- Custom configuration (e.g. plugins, and custom themes)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "serve_dev(tw=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a FastHTML app with the `tw` parameter enabled you'll see an additional link to open Jupyter Lab. By default the source TailwindCSS file is assumed to be located in `./app.css` and the output is saved to `./public/app.css`. Both these paths can be configured by the `tw_src` and `tw_dist` parameters respectively.\n",
    "\n",

    "INFO:     Waiting for application startup.\n",
    "INFO:     Application startup complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## TailwindCSS Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The `serve_dev(tw=True)` function runs the TailwindCSS CLI to watch for class name changes but you need to setup your FastHTML to be Tailwind 'compatible'. This means adding a Tailwind source CSS file and a config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the root of your FastTML project add an `app.css` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "@import \"tailwindcss\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is for TailwindCSS v4. If you're using an older version then use this format instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "@tailwind base;\n",
    "@tailwind components;\n",
    "@tailwind utilities;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your Tailwind CSS file is named something other then `app.css` or is in a different location then you can use the `tw_src` parameter in `serve_dev()` to change the name/path as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing to do is add the generated Tailwind CSS file to the header of your FastHTML site.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app,rt,todos,ToDo = fast_app(\n",
    "\tpico=False,\n",
    "\tlive=True,\n",
    "\thdrs=(\n",
    "\t\tLink(rel=\"stylesheet\", href=f\"/public/app.css{cache_buster() if DEV_MODE else \"\"}\", type=\"text/css\"),\n",
    "\t),\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will add the necessary styles and will also bypass the browser CSS cache via the `fh-dev-utils` `cache_buster()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tailwind Intellisense\n",
    "One of the advantages to building TailwindCSS styles dynamically is that it enables support for auto-completion (intellisense) of Tailwind classes as you type.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get this working you need to be using VS Code and install the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to edit the TailwindCSS VS Code settings so that intellisense is auto-triggered as you edit your FastHTML app source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the JSON user settings in VS Code and add the following settings to the existing ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    " {\n",
    "  \"tailwindCSS.includeLanguages\": {\n",
    "    \"python\": \"html\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex\": [\n",
    "    \"\\\\b[a-zA-Z_]+\\\\s*=\\\\s*[\\\"']([^\\\"']*)[\\\"']\",\n",
    "    \"\\\"[^\\\"]+\\\"\\\\s*:\\\\s*\\\"([^\\\"]*)\\\"\",\n",
    "    \"'[^']+'\\\\s*:\\\\s*'([^']*)'\"\n",
    "  ],\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is set up then you get full intellisense support.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/tw-intellisense1.png\" width=\"750\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus, all colors are highlighted inline too, and you can hover over the Tailwind class to see what the computed CSS will be when rendered!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/tw-intellisense2.png\" width=\"750\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't see a little color swatch next to the Tailwind color classes then intellisense isn't working. This is usually because the TailwindCSS CLI is not running, or you don't have a `tailwind.config.js` added to the root of your FastHTML app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you are using Linux under Windows (WSL) then make sure the Tailwind CSS Intellisense VS Code extension is enabled for WSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Jupyter Notebook Server\n",
    "It is often really useful to add one or more notebooks to your FastHTML to enable quick exploration or research when developing you app. Use it to test things out or as a scratch pad to try out ideas. You can then transfer any code you want to incorporate into the FastHTML app.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `serve_dev()` function makes this super-easy. Simply set the `jupyter` argument to `True`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "serve_dev(jupyter=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a FastHTML app with the `jupyter` parameter enabled you'll see an additional link to open Jupyter Lab. By default port 8036 will be used for the Jupyter lab server but this can be changed via the `jupyter_port` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ python main.py\n",
    "Jupyter Lab link: http://localhost:8036/lab\n",
    "Link: http://localhost:5001\n",

    "INFO:     Waiting for application startup.\n",
    "INFO:     Application startup complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you access to a full Jupyter Lab server that runs along side your FastHTML app.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/jupyter-1.png\" width=\"750\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly useful way to use a notebook to complement your FastHTML app is to view the schema for an SQLite database (only relevant if your app includes a database).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/jupyter-2.png\" width=\"750\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The `fastlite` `diagram()` function requires [`graphviz`](https://graphviz.org/) to be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. SQLite Database Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with an SQLite database in your FastHTML app it is often useful to be able to easily view/edit database data. You can also do this manually via a Jupyter Lab notebook too but it is very convenient to have a dedicated app to be able to interect with your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have included support for the [`sqlite-web`](https://github.com/coleifer/sqlite-web) browser which is written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "serve_dev(db=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a FastHTML app with the `db` parameter enabled you'll see an additional link to open sqlite-web database browser. By default port 8035 will be used for the SQLite browser but this can be changed via the `sqlite_port` parameter. The database file can be configured via `db_path`. By default it is set to `./data/app.db`.\n",
